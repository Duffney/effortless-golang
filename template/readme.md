## Everything I Know About Go \[[template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)\].

Go developers use templates to automate the generation of static documents.

Templates generate data-driven output in the form of plain text and HTML. Such as web pages, emails, and API documentation. 

Using Go's `text/template` and `html/template` packages you can pass data to templates, call functions and methods within a template, and modularize templates by nesting them within one another.
