Templates generate data-driven output in the form of plain text and HTML. Such as web pages, emails, and API documentation. 

Using Go's [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) packages you can pass data to templates, call functions and methods within a template, pipe functions to other functions, and modularize templates by nesting them within one another.
